# Hax Emotion Avatars

Script to change your avatar on haxball for a second, this is useful to call for the ball or just show some emotion!

6,7,8,9 are the default keys but these can easily be changed at the top of the script. As far as I'm aware, this is not against any TOS however, I do not accept responsibility for any damage caused by this script.
